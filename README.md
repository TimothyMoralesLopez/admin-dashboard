This is my Admin Dashboard Project. I am feeling fairly confident going into this project. Again, I am not the strongest in CSS, but I feel like I am getting the hang of Grid and how it works. This project will test my Grid abilities (and maybe some of my Flexbox abilities - might need a refresher on that), but I feel like this project won't take me too, too long to complete. 

This is my Admin Dashboard Project - complete! This project was a lot more complicated than I had originally anticipated it being. I had a few hiccups when I was trying to get the layout done for the content module of the project, but I was able to finally figure it out. It isn't a perfect replica of the example, which is what I was aiming for. However, I do think it is surprisingly close. Much closer than I thought I was capable of doing. The only thing that does worry me a bit is that I had to use quite a bit of static units to get the layout to work in the end, and I realize that doing that is not good for responsiveness for other screen sizes or if the window size changes. But I know that lesson will be coming soon, and for now, I was able to complete the project and present an admin dashboard that looks similar to the example.
